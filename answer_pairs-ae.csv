18,difference between straight and order bill of lading," When the bill of lading is used as a document of title, it is particularly related to the case of buyer. When the buyer is entitled to received goods from the carrier, bill of lading in this case performs as document of title for the goods. There are two types of bill of lading that can perform as document of title. They are straight bill of lading and order bill of lading. Straight bill of lading is a bill of lading issued to a named consignee that is not negotiable. In this case, the bill of lading should be directed only to one specific consignee indicated on the bill of lading. Order bill of lading is the opposite from a straight bill of lading and there is no specific or named consignee. Therefore, an order bill of lading can be negotiated to a third party. ","A straight bill of lading is a document that names a specific receiver for the shipment and requires that the goods be delivered to that person or company only. This type of bill of lading is typically used for shipments where there is only one recipient, such as for household moves or when the goods are being delivered directly to a retail store. 

An order bill of lading, on the other hand, is a document that allows for the transfer of ownership of the goods during transit. The original owner of the goods can endorse the bill of lading, allowing the recipient to take possession of the goods or transfer ownership to someone else. This type of bill of lading is commonly used in commercial transactions where goods are being shipped to a buyer who has not yet paid for them, as the transfer of ownership is tied to the bill of lading.",,,,1,

33,when did the dust bowl end in oklahoma," The Dust Bowl, also known as the Dirty Thirties, was a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the ecology and agriculture of the American and Canadian prairies during the 1930s; severe drought and a failure to apply dryland farming methods to prevent wind erosion (the Aeolian processes) caused the phenomenon. The drought came in three waves, 1934, 1936, and 1939 -- 1940, but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years. With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains, farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade; this had displaced the native, deep - rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds. The rapid mechanization of farm equipment, especially small gasoline tractors, and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers' decisions to convert arid grassland (much of which received no more than 10 inches (250 mm) of precipitation per year) to cultivated cropland. ","The Dust Bowl in Oklahoma began in the 1930s and lasted for several years. However, there is no specific date cited for when it officially ended.

38,when was the cello invented and by whom," The violin family, including cello - sized instruments, emerged c. 1500 as family of instruments distinct from the viola da gamba family. The earliest depictions of the violin family, from northern Italy c. 1530, show three sizes of instruments, roughly corresponding to what we now call violins, violas, and cellos. Contrary to a popular misconception, the cello did not evolve from the viola da gamba, but existed alongside it for about two and a half centuries. The violin family is also known as the viola da braccio (meaning viola of the arm) family, a reference to the primary way the members of the family are held. This is to distinguish it from the viola da gamba (meaning viola of the leg) family, in which all the members are all held with the legs. The likely predecessors of the violin family include the lira da braccio and the rebec. The earliest surviving cellos are made by Andrea Amati, the first known member of the celebrated Amati family of luthiers. ","The cello, which is also known as the violoncello, was developed during the early 16th century in Northern Italy. It is believed to have been invented by Andrea Amati of Cremona, a renowned luthier who was known for his craftsmanship in creating violins.",,,,,
39,what happened at the chernobyl nuclear power plant," The event occurred during a late - night safety test which simulated a station blackout power - failure and in which safety systems were deliberately turned off. A combination of inherent reactor design flaws and the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the test, eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions. Water flashed into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent open - air graphite fire. This fire produced considerable updrafts for about nine days. These lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere. The estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot fire phase approximately equalled in magnitude the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion. Practically all of this radioactive material would then go on to fall - out / precipitate onto much of the surface of the western USSR and Europe. ","On April 26, 1986, an explosion occurred at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, causing a catastrophic nuclear meltdown. The explosion and subsequent fires released large amounts of radioactive particles into the air, contaminating the surrounding area and causing significant health and environmental impacts. The disaster was caused by a combination of human error, design flaws, and a lack of safety protocols. The Chernobyl disaster remains one of the worst nuclear accidents in history.",,,,,
40,where does the term dog and pony show come from," The term was originally used in the United States in the late - 19th and early - 20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. Performances were generally held in open - air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was "" Prof. Gentry 's Famous Dog & Pony Show, '' started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled "" Gentry 's Equine and Canine Paradox. '' It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. Other early dog and pony shows included Morris' Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt 's Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s). ","The term ""dog and pony show"" comes from the practice of traveling salesmen in the 19th century who would use trained dogs and ponies to attract potential customers to their sales pitches. The term has since evolved to refer to any elaborate or flashy presentation meant to impress or convince an audience.",,,,,

42,who was the first signatory of the israeli declaration of independence," As leader of the Yishuv, David Ben - Gurion was the first person to sign. The declaration was due to be signed by all 37 members of Moetzet HaAm. However, twelve members could not attend, eleven of them trapped in besieged Jerusalem and one abroad. The remaining 25 signatories present were called up in alphabetical order to sign, leaving spaces for those absent. Although a space was left for him between the signatures of Eliyahu Dobkin and Meir Vilner, Zerach Warhaftig signed at the top of the next column, leading to speculation that Vilner 's name had been left alone to isolate him, or to stress that even a communist agreed with the declaration. However, Warhaftig later denied this, stating that a space had been left for him (as he was one of the signatories trapped in Jerusalem) where a Hebraicised form of his name would have fitted alphabetically, but he insisted on signing under his actual name so as to honour his father 's memory and so moved down two spaces. He and Vilner would be the last surviving signatories, and remained close for the rest of their lives. Of the signatories, two were women (Golda Meir (Meyerson / Myerson) and Rachel Cohen - Kagan). ","David Ben-Gurion was the first signatory of the Israeli Declaration of Independence on May 14, 1948.

44,when did cable stayed bridges increase in popularity," Cable - stayed bridges have been known since the 16th century and used widely since the 19th. Early examples often combined features from both the cable - stayed and suspension designs, including the famous Brooklyn Bridge. The design fell from favor through the 20th century as larger gaps were bridged using pure suspension designs, and shorter ones using various systems built of reinforced concrete. It once again rose to prominence in the later 20th century when the combination of new materials, larger construction machinery, and the need to replace older bridges all lowered the relative price of these designs. ","Cable-stayed bridges started gaining popularity in the mid-20th century, with the first modern example being the 1950s-built Strömsund Bridge in Sweden. The popularity of cable-stayed bridges continued to increase in the following decades as advancements in engineering and construction techniques made the design more feasible for longer spans and heavier loads. Today, cable-stayed bridges are commonly used for spans ranging from 200 meters up to over 1,000 meters, and are often preferred over other bridge types for their aesthetic appeal and structural efficiency.",,,,,

48,where is the protien made in the cell," Transcription occurs in the cell nucleus, where the DNA is held. The DNA structure of the cell is made up of two helixes made up of sugar and phosphate held together by hydrogen bonds between the bases of opposite strands. The sugar and the phosphate in each strand are joined together by stronger phosphodiester covalent bonds. The DNA is "" unzipped '' (disruption of hydrogen bonds between different single strands) by the enzyme helicase, leaving the single nucleotide chain open to be copied. RNA polymerase reads the DNA strand from the 3 - prime (3') end to the 5 - prime (5') end, while it synthesizes a single strand of messenger RNA in the 5' - to - 3' direction. The general RNA structure is very similar to the DNA structure, but in RNA the nucleotide uracil takes the place that thymine occupies in DNA. The single strand of mRNA leaves the nucleus through nuclear pores, and migrates into the cytoplasm. ","Proteins are made in the cell through the process of protein synthesis, which occurs in the ribosomes. The process involves the transcription of DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA), which then moves out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm, where it attaches to a ribosome. The ribosome then reads the sequence of codons on the mRNA and matches each codon to a specific amino acid. As the ribosome reads the codons, it binds the amino acids together in the correct order to form a polypeptide chain, which eventually becomes a functional protein.",,,,,

51,when did equus first appear in fossil record," The first Old World equid fossil was found in the gypsum quarries in Montmartre, Paris, in the 1820s. The tooth was sent to the Paris Conservatory, where it was identified by Georges Cuvier, who identified it as a browsing equine related to the tapir. His sketch of the entire animal matched later skeletons found at the site. ","Equus, a genus of the family Equidae, first appeared in the fossil record during the Pliocene era, approximately 3.5 million years ago. The earliest known species is thought to be Equus simplicidens, which lived in North America. Over time, different species of Equus evolved and spread to other parts of the world, including Europe, Asia, and Africa. The most well-known species is the modern horse, Equus ferus caballus, which is widely domesticated and used for various purposes such as transportation, sport, and agriculture.",,,,,
52,the rime of the ancient mariner albatross symbolism," It is an allusion to Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1798). In the poem, an albatross starts to follow a ship -- being followed by an albatross was generally considered a sign of good luck. However, the titular mariner shoots the albatross with a crossbow, which is regarded as an act that will curse the ship (which indeed suffers terrible mishaps). Even when they are too thirsty to speak, the ship 's crew let the mariner know through their glances that they blame his action for the curse. The albatross is then literally hung around the mariner 's neck by the crew to symbolize his guilt in killing the bird. Thus, the albatross can be both an omen of good or bad luck, as well as a metaphor for a burden to be carried as penance. ","The albatross in ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" symbolizes nature and the beauty and majesty of creation. It also represents good luck and the favor of the spirits. When the mariner shoots the albatross, he angers the spirits and nature, bringing upon himself a curse that will haunt him and his crewmates throughout their voyage. The dead albatross around his neck becomes a physical reminder of his guilt and the consequences of his actions. Only when he learns to appreciate and respect nature does the curse lift and he finds redemption.",,,,,

54,when are organisms considered to belong to the same species," In biology, a species is the basic unit of classification and a taxonomic rank, as well as a unit of biodiversity, but it has proven difficult to find a satisfactory definition. Scientists and conservationists need a species definition which allows them to work, regardless of the theoretical difficulties. If as Linnaeus thought, species were fixed, there would be no problem, but evolutionary processes cause species to change continually, and to grade into one another. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, when looked at more closely it is problematic. For example, with hybridisation, in a species complex of hundreds of similar microspecies, or in a ring species, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear. Among organisms that reproduce only asexually, the concept of a reproductive species breaks down, and each clone is potentially a microspecies. Problems also arise when dealing with fossils, since reproduction can not be examined; the concept of the chronospecies is therefore used in palaeontology. Other ways of defining species include their karyotype, DNA sequence, morphology, behaviour or ecological niche. ","Organisms are considered to belong to the same species if they can interbreed and produce viable offspring. The Biological Species Concept defines a species as a group of individuals that can readily interbreed and produce fertile offspring, and are separated from other groups by reproductive isolation. However, this concept may not always be applicable, especially in cases where organisms reproduce asexually or hybridize with other species. Other concepts, such as the Morphological Species Concept and the Phylogenetic Species Concept, may also be used to define species based on physical characteristics and evolutionary relationships.",,,,,

64,where does the formation of atp take place," The formation of ATP from ADP and P is energetically unfavorable and would normally proceed in the reverse direction. In order to drive this reaction forward, ATPase couples ATP synthesis during cellular respiration to an electrochemical gradient created by the difference in proton (H) concentration across the mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes or the plasma membrane in bacteria. During photosynthesis in plants, ATP is synthesized by ATPase using a proton gradient created in the thylakoid lumen through the thylakoid membrane and into the chloroplast stroma. ","ATP is primarily formed in the mitochondria of cells through the process of cellular respiration. This process involves the breakdown of glucose and other molecules to release energy, which is used to synthesize ATP through a series of biochemical reactions known as oxidative phosphorylation. However, ATP can also be synthesized through other metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and photosynthesis.",,,,,
65,what is the snow on mars made of," The planet Mars has two permanent polar ice caps. During a pole 's winter, it lies in continuous darkness, chilling the surface and causing the deposition of 25 -- 30 % of the atmosphere into slabs of CO ice (dry ice). When the poles are again exposed to sunlight, the frozen CO sublimes, creating enormous winds that sweep off the poles as fast as 400 km / h. These seasonal actions transport large amounts of dust and water vapor, giving rise to Earth - like frost and large cirrus clouds. Clouds of water - ice were photographed by the Opportunity rover in 2004. ","The snow on Mars is not made of traditional water ice, but rather frozen carbon dioxide, also known as dry ice. This occurs because Mars has a much colder climate than Earth, where temperatures can drop to -125 degrees Celsius (-193 degrees Fahrenheit) during the Martian winter. As carbon dioxide condenses and freezes, it forms a layer of dry ice snow that covers Mars' poles and other areas.",,,,,

78,why did the colonists have a problem with the tea act of 1773," The Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773.

Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain. ","The Tea Act of 1773 was a British law that placed a tax on tea imported to the American colonies by the British East India Company. The colonists saw the tax as a violation of their right to be taxed only by their own elected representatives, as they had no representation in the British Parliament. The colonists also saw it as a way for the British government to use its power to control the colonial economy and to unfairly favor the British East India Company, which had a monopoly over the tea trade. The Tea Act led to the Boston Tea Party, where colonists disguised as Native Americans threw British tea into the harbor in protest.

The colour difference arises mainly from the whiteness of myelin. In living tissue, grey matter actually has a very light grey colour with yellowish or pinkish hues, which come from capillary blood vessels and neuronal cell bodies. ","Dendrites and cell bodies are components of gray matter found in the brain.

94,when does a limit of a function not exist," Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f(x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f(x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to p are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, we say the limit does not exist. ","The limit of a function does not exist at a point x if and only if at least one of the following conditions are true: 
1. The right-hand limit and the left-hand limit of the function at x exist, but they are not equal.
2. The right-hand limit or the left-hand limit of the function at x does not exist or is infinite.
